  //Credit to Professor Michal ForiÅ¡ek, who came up with this lexicographic algorithm for permutations of a given sequence
  //I got this permutation algorithm from:
    // https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-an-algorithm-that-generates-permutations-using-lexicographic-ordering
  
  // STEP 1: find int in sequence in such a way that the next int is larger than it, but the int after that is smallerthan the one before.
  //If no int is found that meets such criteria, then all permutations have run their course. (think: 1,2,3 -> 3,2,1 should be last permutation)

    }
  }

    // STEP 2 next, find the next largest number so that this new number 
    int largestJ = -1;
    for (int j = 0; j < sequence.length; j++) {
      if (sequence[largestI] < sequence[j]) {
        largestJ = j;
      }
    }
    // STEP 3
    swap(sequence, largestI, largestJ);

    // STEP 4: reverse from largestI + 1 to the end
    int size = sequence.length - largestI - 1;
    int[] endArray = new int[size];
    arrayCopy(sequence, largestI + 1, endArray, 0, size);
    endArray = reverse(endArray);
    arrayCopy(endArray, 0, sequence, largestI+1, size);
